# 3D Pokedex AR App

## Overview
The 3D Pokedex AR App is an immersive augmented reality application that brings the original 151 Pokémon from Generation 1 to life. By leveraging the power of ARKit and SceneKit, this app allows users to interact with 3D models of their favorite Pokémon in real-time, using physical Pokémon trading cards as triggers.

## Features
- **Augmented Reality (AR) Interaction:** The app uses ARKit for real-time tracking and display of 3D Pokémon models over physical Pokémon trading cards.
- **Comprehensive Pokedex:** Includes all 151 original Pokémon from Generation 1, allowing users to explore and interact with each Pokémon in a fully immersive AR environment.
- **Simultaneous Display:** Supports the simultaneous display of multiple Pokémon models, enhancing user interaction and experience.
- **Immersive AR Scenes:** Integrated with SceneKit to render realistic AR scenes with dynamic lighting and shadows, creating a more engaging experience.

## Technologies Used
- **ARKit:** Utilized for real-time tracking and rendering of Pokémon models in the physical world.
- **SceneKit:** Integrated to provide high-quality 3D graphics with realistic lighting and shadows.
